<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>
Xu Cheng(Member, IEEE) received the Ph.D. degree in engineering from the Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Department of Ocean Operations and Civil Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Ålesund, Norway, in June 2020.
From June 2020 to March 2022, he was a Post-Doctoral Fellow and a Researcher with the Department of Manufacturing and Civil Engineering, Gjøvik, Norway. Since April 2022, he has been a Permanent Researcher with Smart Innovation Norway, Halden, Norway. He is currently a Full Professor at the Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China. He has applied for and coordinated more than five projects supported by the Norwegian Research Council (NFR), the EU, and industry. He has published more than 60 articles as first and co-author in his research interests, including data analysis and artificial intelligence in maritime operations, time series analysis, and predictive maintenance of wind turbines.
